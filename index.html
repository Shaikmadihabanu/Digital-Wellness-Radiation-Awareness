    <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
    <h4> The rapid growth of mobile and internet usage has transformed various aspects of life, including 
communication, education, and business. However, Additionally, excessive mobile 
usage among youth raises concerns about exposure to mobile radiation and its potential health 
effects. This project aims to bridge the digital divide by educating villagers on safe internet practices 
while raising awareness of mobile radiation risks. A survey will be conducted in rural areas and 
schools to assess mobile usage patterns and awareness levels. Awareness programs will cover 
mobile banking, cyber safety, online government services, and the effects of radiation exposure. 
Demonstrations using EMF detector apps will help people understand radiation levels and adopt 
measures to reduce exposure. </p>
    <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>Conducted surveys among youth and families.</li>
      <li>Collected data through questionnaires & interview</li> 
       <li>Website Development</li>
      <li>Informative content on radiation and mobile usage</li>
        <li>Survey results and visuals</li>
         <li>Tips for safe mobile practices</li>
           <li>The website is accessible to everyone and serves as a digital awareness platform</li>

    <h2>Radiation & Mobile Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>Radiation emitted from mobile phones and internet towers is known as Radio Frequency (RF) radiation. With the rapid rise of mobile networks like 4G and 5G and the increasing dependency on smartphones, radiation exposure levels have also increased significantly. Although RF radiation is considered non-ionizing and less harmful than ionizing radiation like X-rays, prolonged exposure‚Äîespecially due to excessive mobile usage‚Äîcan still affect health. Studies suggest that long-term exposure may lead to sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, reduced concentration, and stress, particularly among youth. As digital devices become a part of daily life, it's essential to use them responsibly and be aware of the potential health risks associated with continuous radiation exposure.</p>
    <p>Long-term exposure can cause health problems like headaches, sleep issues, and fatigue, especially in youth who use phones excessively.</p>

  <section id="precautions" class="page">
    <h2>Precautions & Awareness</h2>
    <p>To minimize the harmful effects of mobile radiation, it's important to adopt simple safety measures. Use speaker mode or wired earphones to reduce direct contact with the head during calls. Limit mobile phone usage, especially during nighttime, to prevent sleep disturbances and fatigue. Keep phones away from the body when not in use to reduce prolonged exposure. Educating the public through awareness programs and digital platforms can help promote safer habits. Additionally, practicing healthy screen time routines‚Äîsuch as taking regular breaks and maintaining a balance between online and offline activities‚Äîcan significantly reduce radiation risks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use speaker mode or earphones to avoid direct head exposure.</li>
      <li>Avoid long mobile usage, especially at night.</li>
      <li>Keep phones away from the body when not in use.</li>
      <li>Educate people through campaigns and digital platforms.</li>
      <li>Follow healthy screen time habits to reduce radiation risks.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="Conclusion" class="page">
    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, while mobile phones and internet connectivity have become essential parts of our lives, it is equally important to be aware of their potential health impacts‚Äîespecially due to prolonged exposure to mobile radiation. By understanding the risks, educating ourselves and others, and adopting safe usage practices, we can ensure that technology enhances our lives without harming our well-being. Awareness, responsibility, and mindful usage are the keys to maintaining a healthy balance in this digital age.</p>
